              We've built this template with performance in mind, so all pages
              will get a 96 or more score on Google Lighthouse performance
              testing. You can inspect the template performance by opening the
              Google Chrome Inspector and moving to the last tab named
              "Lighthouse". On that tab click on "Generate report".
            </Typography>
            <Typography paragraph>
              We designed multiple color schemes that can be switched from the
              Settings button in the live preview screen corner.

            <Typography paragraph>
              Based on our experience in developing applications user interfaces
              we chose popular niche areas for the dashboard pages, applications
              and management sections. We understand that these might not be
              enough for your app's needs. That's why we are offering to build
              custom pages based on your needs, if we feel that your requested
              page design might benefit multiple customers or if they aren't too
              specific to a particular products niche.

              <code>support@bloomui.freshdesk.com</code>
              with a wireframe, prototype or design for the requested pages.
              After our initial review, we will contact you and let you know if
              we'll be integrating your custom page in Tokyo React Admin
              Dashboard.
